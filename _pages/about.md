Hi, thanks for visiting! ü§ù

I'm a research faculty
in the Michigan Institute for Imaging Technology and Translation
(<a href='https://miitt.med.umich.edu/'>MIITT</a>),
Department of Radiology, University of Michigan (<a href='https://umich.edu/'>UMICH</a>)
in Ann Arbor, USA.

I was a postdoctoral scientist
supervised by <a href='https://www.cil.tf.fau.de/person/knoll/'>Prof. Dr. Florian Knoll</a>
at the Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg (<a href='https://www.fau.de/'>FAU</a>).
I enjoyed the time with Prof. Knoll
building efficient deep learning reconstruction methods
for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Meanwhile, I was a lecturer on the core master study module
"Computational Imaging Project", mentoring about 8 master students per semester.
Before that, I was a postdoctoral project leader sponsored by the German Research Foundation (<a href='https://www.dfg.de/en'>DFG</a>)
at the University Medical Center Goettingen (<a href='https://www.umg.eu/'>UMG</a>) and
adjunct at Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences (<a href='https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/en'>MPINAT</a>). I worked with <a href='https://www.tugraz.at/institute/ibi/home'>Prof. Dr. Martin Uecker</a> and <a href='https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jens_Frahm'>Prof. Dr. Jens Frahm</a> developing advanced pulse sequences and iterative reconstruction methods for fast MRI.

I'm interested in MRI physics and optimization methods.
I've acquired vast hands-on experience in developing efficient data sampling schemes
for MRI, exploring advanced deep neural networks for data-driven image reconstructions,
and publishing research outcomes in medical imaging journals.
