**Julius Glaser**'s work on deep nonlinear subspace modelling and reconstruction for diffusion-weighted imaging has been selected for Power Pitch Presentation in the ISMRM workshop on 40 Years of Diffusion: Past, Present & Future Perspectives. **Julius** was a master-thesis student mentored by **Z. Tan** during his time at the Friedrich-Alexander-University (FAU) of Erlangen-Nuremberg. Congratulation!
