Congrats to **Dr. X Wang**, my former colleague back in [MPI](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/en), who published his work on [fetal brain R2* mapping](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30604) using multi-echo radial FLASH and model-based reconstruction in **Magnetic Resonance in Medicine**. **Z Tan** has been the main developer on the multi-echo radial sampling sequence. This publication has been a proof of our great collaboration!
