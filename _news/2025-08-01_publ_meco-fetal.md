Congrats to **Dr. X Wang**, my former colleague back in <a href='https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/en'>MPI</a>, who published his work on <a href='https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.30604'>fetal brain R2* mapping</a> using multi-echo radial FLASH and model-based reconstruction in <a href='https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15222594'>Magnetic Resonance in Medicine</a>. **Z Tan** has been the main developer on the multi-echo radial sampling sequence. This publication has been a proof of our great collaboration!
